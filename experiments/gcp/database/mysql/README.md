# Terraform for creating a GCP MySQL database instance

Sometimes you need a database.  Why not use Google Cloud Platform's Cloud SQL?

Cloud SQL is an easy-to-use service that delivers fully managed SQL databases in the cloud. Cloud SQL provides PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MySQL databases.

This sample takes advantage of the [mysql](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/GoogleCloudPlatform/sql-db/google/3.2.0/submodules/mysql) sub-module of [sql-db](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/GoogleCloudPlatform/sql-db/google/3.2.0) within the Terraform Registry.

Starts with the assumption that you will use a service account's credentials that has appropriate role/permissions to create/delete a Cloud SQL database instance.

## Copy sample configuration

```
cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
```

## Edit `terraform.tfvars`

Amend the values for

* `project`
* `region`
* `zone`
* `database_version`
* `database_tier`
* `database_username`
* `encryption_key_name`
* `name`
* `additional_databases`
* `additional_users`
* `service_account_credentials`

## Create

```
./create-database.sh
```

## Use

You'll probably want to connect to the database instance you just created, huh?

In order to obtain the ssl_key, ssl_cert, and ssl_ca you'll, there's a convenient script to generate them and a sample [mysql](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-admin-ip#connect-ssl) client command

Change directories

```
cd ../connect
```

### Copy sample configuration

```
cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
```

### Edit terraform.tfvars 

Amend values for

* `project`
* `region`
* `instance_name`
* `database_name`
* `database_username`
* `instance_public_ip_address`
* `service_account_credentials`

### Obtain encrypted connection details

```
./create-connection.sh
```

### Destroy encrypted connection details

```
./destroy-connection.sh
```

## Destroy

To tear it down

```
./destroy-database.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're going to setup the database instance with an `encryption_key_name` then you will need to perform some work outside of Terraform as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-cmek#grantkey).  The service account you use to create the database instance must also have the `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` role assigned.


## Creating a database for use with Cloud Service Broker

Use this sample `terraform.tfvars` replacing values as appropriate

```
project = "fe-cphillipson"
region = "us-west1"
zone = "c"
database_version = "MYSQL_5_7"
database_tier = "db-f1-micro"
database_username = "admin"
encryption_key_name = ""
name = "pivotal-csb"
additional_databases = [ { project = "fe-cphillipson", name = "servicebroker", charset = "utf8", collation = "utf8_general_ci", instance = "pivotal-csb" } ]
additional_users = []
service_account_credentials = "~/.ssh/FE-cphillipson-c116bc661602.json"
```
