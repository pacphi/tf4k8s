# Terraform for Kubernetes

An exploration into the use of Terraform to provision Kubernetes clusters on popular IaaS.

## Vision

Launch a relatively comprehensive end-to-end demo environment for discussion purposes and/or hands-on workshops in under an hour.

## Organization

Sub-directories of this repository contain

* `bom`
  * Bill of materials; what do you need to get started?
* `experiments`
  * Progressively build out a platform to deliver software delivery agility underpinned by Kubernetes
* `modules`
  * Building blocks to be composed as you see fit
* `ytt-libs`
  * YAML-based templates consumed by [ytt](https://get-ytt.io) then deployed with [kapp](https://get-kapp.io)

## Supported IaaS

Get started with...

- [x] [Google Cloud Platform (GKE)](experiments/gcp)
- [x] [Microsoft Azure (AKS)](experiments/azure)
- [ ] Amazon Web Service (EKS)
- [ ] vSphere 7 with Kubernetes (Tanzu Kubernetes Grid)

## Current experiments

- [x] Identity management
- [x] Add DNS Zone management
- [x] Add Certificate management
- [x] Add Ingress and External DNS
- [x] Install Harbor
- [x] Install cf-for-k8s
- [x] Install VMWare Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes
- [x] Install VMWare Tanzu Build Service

## Roadmap

Above-mentioned experiments will evolve to include automating base configuration and installation of an additional complement of capabilities/components aimed at modeling a modern enterprise software factory / product delivery supply chain.
