# Terraform for Kubernetes

An exploration into the use of Terraform to provision Kubernetes clusters on popular IaaS.

## Vision

Launch a relatively comprehensive end-to-end demo environment for discussion purposes and/or hands-on workshops in under an hour.

## Getting Started

Choose your own adventure on one of the following cloud providers

- [x] [Google Cloud Platform (GKE)](experiments/gcp)
- [x] [Microsoft Azure (AKS)](experiments/azure)
- [x] [Amazon Web Service (EKS)](experiments/amazon)
- [x] VMWare Tanzu Kubernetes Grid 
  - on AWS [management](experiments/tkg/aws/mgmt) and [workload](experiments/tkg/aws/workload) clusters
  - on Azure [management](experiments/tkg/azure/mgmt) and [workload](experiments/tkg/azure/workload) clusters

Or provision new / attach existing Kubernetes clusters via

- [ ] VMWare Tanzu Mission Control

## Organization

Sub-directories of this repository contain

* `bom`
  * Bill of materials; what do you need to get started?
* `experiments`
  * Progressively build out a platform to deliver software delivery agility underpinned by Kubernetes
* `modules`
  * Building blocks to be composed as you see fit
* `ytt-libs`
  * YAML-based templates consumed by [ytt](https://get-ytt.io) then deployed with [kapp](https://get-kapp.io)


## Roadmap

Above-mentioned experiments will evolve to include automating base configuration and installation of an additional complement of capabilities/components aimed at modeling a modern enterprise software factory / product delivery supply chain.
